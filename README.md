1. Airline frequencies

Vistara dominates with the highest number of flights.

Air India comes second, followed by IndiGo.

SpiceJet and AirAsia have much smaller shares.
ðŸ‘‰ This suggests Vistara and Air India were the biggest players in this dataset, maybe reflecting long-haul and premium routes.

2. Departure vs. Arrival times

Most departures happen in the Morning and Early Morning.

Most arrivals are in the Night and Evening.
ðŸ‘‰ Airlines schedule flights so that business travelers can leave early morning and return by night.

3. Ticket prices by class & airline

Business class is massively more expensive than Economy (up to â‚¹50,000+).

Among airlines, Vistara and Air India have the costliest business tickets.

Low-cost carriers (SpiceJet, AirAsia, IndiGo, Go First) keep prices lower in Economy.
ðŸ‘‰ This shows a clear divide: full-service vs. low-cost carriers.

4. Source vs. Destination city price patterns

Prices vary significantly by route.

For example, flights from Delhi to Kolkata or Chennai are pricier than Delhi â†’ Hyderabad.

From Mumbai, prices rise for Kolkata and Chennai compared to nearby Bangalore.
ðŸ‘‰ Longer distances and fewer flights on certain routes lead to higher prices.

âœ… Overall story:

Vistara and Air India dominate in volume and premium fares.

Mornings are busiest for departures; nights for arrivals.

Clear difference between low-cost carriers (affordable economy) vs. full-service airlines (premium, costly business).

Price trends vary strongly by route â€” not just by airline.
